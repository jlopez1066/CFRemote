	<section class="full general" style="text-align: left;">
		<h3 class="padBottom">General</h3> 
		<p><strong>HOW DOES A BUNDLE &amp; SAVE PACKAGE WORK?</strong><br>
			A Bundle &amp; Save Package allows you to get a great deal on any frame collection, not just the ones on sale. For one great price, you’ll get a frame, any two standard mats and Conservation Clear® glass. Visit the store to see a Certified Framing Expert for more information.</p>
		<!-- <p><strong>WHAT MAKES CUSTOM FRAMING AT MICHAELS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER CUSTOM FRAME STORE?</strong><br>
			When you visit a Certified Framing Expert at Michaels, you not only get the associate’s artistic talent and framing expertise, but you also get the knowledge of the rest of the team. Supporting your Expert is a team of hundreds of other framers. This is customer service and teamwork on a national level. It’s really unmatched by any other frame store.</p>
		<p><strong>WHAT TIPS DO YOU HAVE FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO CUSTOM FRAME FOR THE FIRST TIME?</strong><br>
			Look for framing inspiration on the Internet or take pictures of the space where you want to hang your artwork to bring in for your consultation.</p> -->
		<p><strong>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY COMPLETED ORDER?</strong><br>
			Approximately 14 days, but we do offer seven-day expedited service for an additional charge.</p>
		<p><strong>WHAT IF I NEED TO GET SOMETHING FRAMED AT THE LAST MINUTE?</strong><br>
			Ask any Certified Framing Expert about Custom Frame Express. We’ll pair an off-the-shelf frame (or a frame you already own) with a custom mat and glazing to give you some of the benefits of a custom frame—but much faster. In most cases, it takes only 24 hours.</p>
		<p><strong>HOW IS MY ARTWORK INSERTED INTO THE FRAME?</strong><br>
			It depends on the artwork, but we offer several mounting methods, from dry mount to stitched mount and preservation-grade mount.</p>
		<p><strong>DO YOU SHIP OR DELIVER?</strong><br>
			Sorry, not at this time. </p>
		<p><strong>CAN I PURCHASE A MAT OR GLASS WITHOUT PURCHASING A FRAME?</strong><br>
			You certainly can! Many of our customers want to refresh a previously framed item, and this is a great solution. We can even add any mat or glazing to an off-the-shelf frame. Ask one of our Certified Framing Experts about Custom Frame Express.</p>
		<p><strong>WHAT IS A GLAZING?</strong><br>
			A glazing is any kind of material on the outside of the frame used to protect the artwork. We offer glass, acrylic and Print Guard. Glass or acrylic are recommended for custom frames because they protect the artwork from pollution and harmful UV light. Print Guard is a water-resistant, scratch-resistant laminate glazing for flat, printed art.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW WILL I KNOW HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT FRAME?</strong><br> 
			Bring your artwork to one of our stores and get a free consultation from one of our Certified Framing Experts. They will guide you step-by-step through the process, helping you choose a design based off your style and what would best suit the artwork. You’ll even be able to view what your frame looks like in different virtual room settings with our in-store visualizer. </p>
		<p><strong>HOW WIDE SHOULD MY MAT BE?</strong><br> 
			It depends on the size of your art and the frame you choose. However, our Certified Framing Experts think that wider mats create a better stage—so to speak—for most artwork.</p>
		<p><strong>I CANNOT SEE MY ART BECAUSE THE GLASS IS SO REFLECTIVE! IS THERE A NON-GLARE GLAZING AVAILABLE?</strong><br> 
			Our Conservation Masterpiece® glass and acrylic glazings provide reduced reflections, amazing clarity and 99% UV protection.</p>
		<p><strong>ARE MY MATERIALS TOO THICK FOR THE PICTURE FRAME?</strong><br> 
			Probably not. After all, these are custom frames and shadow boxes! We can add space to the back of a frame or layer frames to build enough depth for dimensional objects.</p>

	<section class="full preservation faqBlock">
		<h3 class="padBottom">Preservation Techniques</h3>
		<p><strong>THE AREA I WANT TO HANG MY FRAME IN HAS DIRECT SUNLIGHT. IS THERE GLASS I CAN USE TO PROTECT THE ART?</strong><br> 
			We offer four different glazing options, and all of them provide 99% UV protection. </p>
		<p><strong>WHAT KIND OF TAPE DO YOU USE TO ATTACH MY ART TO THE MAT?</strong><br> 
			Because a preservation mount (placing the art on a board to go into the frame) needs to be removable and reversible, we use archival photo corners.</p>
		<p><strong>HOW DO YOU AVOID THE COLLECTION OF MOISTURE BETWEEN MY ART AND THE GLAZING?</strong><br> 
			In many cases, moisture is present in the artwork itself, so only proper spacing will prevent it from sticking to the glass. Our Certified Framing Experts use mats and/or spacers to create a gap and allow for airflow between the art and the glazing.</p>
		<p><strong>HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT MY ARTWORK IS SAFE FROM THE EFFECTS OF ACID OVER TIME?</strong><br> 
			All of our custom frames are preservation-quality and acid-free. We also use aluminum barrier tape to line the inside of your frame, preventing any acid from the wooden frame from migrating to the artwork.</p>

		<h3 class="padBottom">Pricing</h3>
		<p><strong>HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO FRAME MY ARTWORK?</strong><br> 
			While the exact price depends on the design choices you make and the size of your artwork, we will help you find an option that suits both your style and your budget. Visit a Certified Framing Expert to get a free consultation and price estimate.</p>
		<p><strong>ARE THERE VARIOUS PRICE OPTIONS AVAILABLE?</strong><br>

		<p><strong>HOW DO I KNOW WHAT HARDWARE I NEED FOR MY FRAME?</strong><br>
			You don’t need to worry. Our Certified Framing Experts install hanging hardware on the back of each custom frame. We take the size and weight of your piece into account and install the appropriate hardware.</p>
