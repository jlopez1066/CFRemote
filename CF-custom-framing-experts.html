		<p><br><strong>Prior to working at Michaels, what kind of framing experience did you have?</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
		I learned a lot about design during college. I studied interior design, color theory and art history, and I worked as a carpenter and painter of scenic art. At the time, custom framing seemed like a very natural transition. I also learned a lot about preserving and curating art from working in a gallery in Dallas that carried prints and maps.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<strong>What makes custom framing at Michaels different from any other custom frame store?</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
		When you visit a Certified Framing Expert at Michaels, you not only get the associate’s artistic talent and framing expertise, but you also get the knowledge of the rest of the team. Supporting your Expert is a team of hundreds of other framers. This is customer service and teamwork on a national level. It’s really unmatched by any other frame store.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<strong>What’s the most memorable custom framing order you’ve ever done?</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
		It was a series of posters from a yearly music festival. After each of his annual trips, the customer would return to custom frame the new additions to his collection and share travel stories with me. Eventually, all his posters were framed in similar moldings with unique mats and displayed in a “hallway of memories” in his home. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<strong>What tips do you have for someone who wants to custom frame for the first time?</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
		Look for framing inspiration on the Internet or take pictures of the space where you want to hang your artwork to bring in for your consultation.</p>
